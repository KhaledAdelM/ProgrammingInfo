                        Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse.The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed.<span><a href="#">read more</a></span>

                        Java is a programming language and computing platform first released by Sun Microsystems in 1995. There are lots of applications and websites that will not work unless you have Java installed, and more are created every day. Java is fast, secure, and reliable. From laptops to datacenters, game consoles to scientific
                        supercomputers, cell phones to the Internet, Java is everywhere! The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but it has fewer low-level facilities than either of them.
                        but it has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. As of 2019, Java was one of the most popular programming languages in use according to GitHub, particularly
                        for client-server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers.

                        JS is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification .JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm.
                        It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is
                        one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web. JavaScript enables interactive web pages and is an essential part of web applications.
                        The vast majority of websites use it for client-side page behavior,and all major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it.
                        JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but they are now embedded in some servers, usually via Node.js. They are also embedded in
                        a variety of applications created with frameworks such as Electron and Cordova.

                        Kotlin is an open-source, statically-typed programming language that supports both object-oriented and functional programming. Kotlin provides similar syntax and concepts from other languages, including C#, Java, and Scala, among many others. Kotlin does not aim to be unique—instead, it draws inspiration from decades of language development. It exists in variants that target the JVM (Kotlin/JVM), JavaScript (Kotlin/JS), and native code (Kotlin/Native). Kotlin is officially supported by Google for Android development, meaning that Android documentation and tooling is designed with Kotlin in mind. Kotlin has been included as an alternative to the standard Java compiler.

                        Rust is a multi-paradigm programming language focused on performance and safety,
                        especially safe concurrency.Rust is syntactically similar to C++,but provides memory safety without using garbage collection. The concrete syntax of Rust is similar to C and C++, with blocks of code delimited by curly brackets, and control flow keywords such as if, else, while, and for. Not all C or C++ keywords are implemented, however,  and some Rust functions (such as the use of the keyword match for pattern matching) will be less familiar to those versed in these languages. Rust is blazingly fast and memory-efficient with no runtime or garbage collector, it can power performance-critical services, run on embedded devices, and easily integrate with other languages.
