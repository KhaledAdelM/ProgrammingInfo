                        <h2>Creation at Netscape</h2>
                        <p>
                              The Mosaic web browser was released in 1993. As the first browser with a graphical user interface accessible to non-technical people, it played a prominent role in the rapid
                              growth of the nascent World Wide Web.<sup><a href="#ref">[1]</a></sup> The lead developers of Mosaic then founded the Netscape corporation, which released
                              a more polished browser, Netscape Navigator, in 1994. Navigator quickly became the most used browser.<sup><a href="#ref">[2]</a></sup>
                              <br>
                              During these formative years of the Web, web pages could only be static, lacking the capability for dynamic behavior after the page was loaded in the browser. There was a desire in the burgeoning web development scene
                              to remove this limitation, so in 1995, Netscape decided to add a scripting language to Navigator. They pursued two routes to achieve this: collaborating with Sun Microsystems
                              to embed the Java programming language, while also hiring Brendan Eich to embed the Scheme language.<sup><a href="#ref">[3]</a></sup>
                              <br>
                              Netscape management soon decided that the best option was for Eich to devise a new language, with syntax similar to Java and less like Scheme or other extant scripting
                              languages.<sup><a href="#ref">[3]</a></sup> Although the new language and its interpreter implementation were officially called LiveScript when first shipped as part of
                              a Navigator release in September 1995, the name was changed to JavaScript three months later.<sup><a href="#ref">[3]</a><a href="#ref">[4]</a></sup>
                              <br>
                              The choice of the JavaScript name has caused confusion, sometimes giving the impression that it is a spin-off of Java. Since Java was the hot new programming language
                              at the time, this has been characterized as a marketing ploy by Netscape to give its own new language cachet.<sup><a href="#ref">[5]</a></sup></p>
                        <h2>Adoption by Microsoft</h2>
                        <p>
                             Microsoft debuted Internet Explorer in 1995, leading to a browser war with Netscape. On the JavaScript front, Microsoft reverse-engineered the Navigator interpreter
                             to create its own, called JScript. JScript was first released in 1996, alongside initial support for CSS and extensions to HTML. Each of these implementations was noticeably
                             different from their counterparts in Navigator.<sup><a href="#ref">[6]</a><a href="#ref">[7]</a></sup> These differences made it difficult for developers to make their websites work well in both browsers, leading to widespread
                             use of "best viewed in Netscape" and "best viewed in Internet Explorer" logos for several years.<sup><a href="#ref">[6]</a><a href="#ref">[8]</a></sup></p>
                        <h2>The rise of JScript</h2>
                        <p>
                             In November 1996, Netscape submitted JavaScript to ECMA International, as the starting point for a standard specification that all browser vendors could conform to.
                             This led to the official release of the first ECMAScript language specification in June 1997.
                             <br>
                             The standards process continued for a few years, with the release of ECMAScript 2 in June 1998 and ECMAScript 3 in December 1999. Work on ECMAScript 4 began in 2000.
                             Meanwhile, Microsoft gained an increasingly dominant position in the browser market. By the early 2000s, Internet Explorer's market share reached 95%.<sup><a href="#ref">[9]</a></sup>
                             This meant that JScript became the de facto standard for client-side scripting on the Web.
                             <br>
                             Microsoft initially participated in the standards process and implemented some proposals in its JScript language, but eventually it stopped collaborating on ECMA work.
                             Thus ECMAScript 4 was mothballed. </p>
                        <h2>Growth and standardization</h2>
                        <p>
                             During the period of Internet Explorer dominance in the early 2000s, client-side scripting was stagnant. This started to change in 2004, when the successor of Netscape,
                             Mozilla, released the Firefox browser. Firefox was well-received by many, taking significant market share from Internet Explorer.<sup><a href="#ref">[10]</a></sup>

                             In 2005, Mozilla joined ECMA International, and work started on the ECMAScript for XML (E4X) standard. This led to Mozilla working jointly with Macromedia
                             (later acquired by Adobe Systems), who were implementing E4X in their ActionScript 3 language, which was based on an ECMAScript 4 draft. The goal became standardizing
                             ActionScript 3 as the new ECMAScript 4. To this end, Adobe Systems released the Tamarin implementation as an open source project. However, Tamarin and
                             ActionScript 3 were too different from established client-side scripting, and without cooperation from Microsoft, ECMAScript 4 never reached fruition.
                             <br>
                             Meanwhile, very important developments were occurring in open source communities not affiliated with ECMA work. In 2005, Jesse James Garrett released a white paper in
                             which he coined the term Ajax and described a set of technologies, of which JavaScript was the backbone, to create web applications where data can be loaded in
                             the background, avoiding the need for full page reloads. This sparked a renaissance period of JavaScript, spearheaded by open source libraries and the communities that
                             formed around them. Many new libraries were created, including jQuery, Prototype, Dojo Toolkit, and MooTools.
                             Google debuted its Chrome browser in 2008, with the V8 JavaScript engine that was the first to use just-in-time compilation, significantly improving execution times.<sup><a href="#ref">[11]</a><a href="#ref">[12]</a></sup>
                             Other browser vendors needed to overhaul their engines to compete.<sup><a href="#ref">[13]</a></sup>
                             <br>
                             In July 2008, these disparate parties came together for a conference in Oslo. This led to the eventual agreement in early 2009 to combine all relevant work and drive
                             the language forward. The result was the ECMAScript 5 standard, released in December 2009. </p>
                        <h2>Reaching maturity</h2>
                        <p>
                             Ambitious work on the language continued for several years, culminating in an extensive collection of additions and refinements being formalized with the publication of
                             ECMAScript 6 in 2015.<sup><a href="#ref">[14]</a></sup>
                             <br>
                             From 2016 to 2019, a new version of the ECMAScript standard was published each year, but the scope of changes was much smaller than
                             the 5th or 6th editions. Thus JavaScript can now be considered a mature language that has largely settled down.
                             <br>
                             The current JavaScript ecosystem has many libraries and frameworks, established programming practices, and increased usage of JavaScript outside of web browsers.
                             Plus, with the rise of single-page applications and other JavaScript-heavy websites, a number of transpilers have been created to aid the development process.<sup><a href="#ref">[15]</a></sup> </p>

                            <p>
                                JavaScript supports much of the structured programming syntax from C (e.g., if statements, while loops, switch statements, do while loops, etc.). One partial exception is scoping:
                                JavaScript originally had only function scoping with var. ECMAScript 2015 added keywords let and const for block scoping, meaning JavaScript now has both function and
                                block scoping. Like C, JavaScript makes a distinction between expressions and statements. One syntactic difference from C is automatic semicolon insertion, which allows
                                the semicolons that would normally terminate statements to be omitted.<sup><a href="#ref">[18]</a></sup></p>

                                    <li>The binary " + " operator casts both operands to a string unless both operands are numbers. This is because the addition operator doubles as a concatenation operator</li>

                                JavaScript is dynamically typed like most other scripting languages. A type is associated with a value rather than an expression. For example, a variable initially bound to
                                a number may be reassigned to a string.<sup><a href="#ref">[20]</a></sup> JavaScript supports various ways to test the type of objects, including duck typing.<sup><a href="#ref">[21]</a></sup>
                                <br>
                                <b>Run-time evaluation:</b>
                                JavaScript includes an eval function that can execute statements provided as strings at run-time.

                            <h2>Object-orientation (prototype-based)</h2>
                            <p>
                                Prototypal inheritance in JavaScript is described by Douglas Crockford as:<br>
                                You make prototype objects, and then … make new instances. Objects are mutable in JavaScript, so we can augment the new instances, giving them new fields and methods.
                                These can then act as prototypes for even newer objects. We don't need classes to make lots of similar objects… Objects inherit from objects. What could be more object
                                oriented than that?<sup><a href="#ref">[22]</a></sup>
                                <br>
                                In JavaScript, an object is an associative array, augmented with a prototype (see below); each string key provides the name for an object property, and there are two
                                syntactical ways to specify such a name: dot notation (obj.x = 10) and bracket notation (obj['x'] = 10). A property may be added, rebound, or deleted at run-time.
                                Most properties of an object (and any property that belongs to an object's prototype inheritance chain) can be enumerated using a for...in loop.<br>
                                JavaScript has a small number of built-in objects, including Function and Date.</p>

                                  JavaScript and the DOM provide the potential for malicious authors to deliver scripts to run on a client computer via the Web. Browser authors minimize
                                  this risk using two restrictions. First, scripts run in a sandbox in which they can only perform Web-related actions, not general-purpose programming tasks
                                  like creating files. Second, scripts are constrained by the same-origin policy: scripts from one Web site do not have access to information such as usernames,
                                  passwords, or cookies sent to another site. Most JavaScript-related security bugs are breaches of either the same origin policy or the sandbox.
                                  There are subsets of general JavaScript—ADsafe, Secure ECMAScript (SES)—that provide greater levels of security, especially on code created by
                                  third parties (such as advertisements).<sup><a href="#ref">[23]</a><a href="#ref">[24]</a></sup> Caja is another project for safe embedding and isolation of third-party JavaScript and HTML.
                                  Content Security Policy is the main intended method of ensuring that only trusted code is executed on a Web page. </p>
                            <h3>Misplaced trust in the client</h3>
                            <p>Developers of client-server applications must recognize that untrusted clients may be under the control of attackers. The application author cannot assume
                                  that their JavaScript code will run as intended (or at all) because any secret embedded in the code could be extracted by a determined adversary.
                                  Some implications are:
                                  <ul>
                                        <li>Web site authors cannot perfectly conceal how their JavaScript operates because the raw source code must be sent to the client. The code can be
                                             obfuscated, but obfuscation can be reverse-engineered.</li>
                                        <li>JavaScript form validation only provides convenience for users, not security. If a site verifies that the user agreed to its terms of service, or
                                             filters invalid characters out of fields that should only contain numbers, it must do so on the server, not only the client.</li>
                                        <li>Scripts can be selectively disabled, so JavaScript cannot be relied on to prevent operations such as right-clicking on an image to save it.<sup><a href="#ref">[25]</a></sup></li>
                                        <li>It is considered very bad practice to embed sensitive information such as passwords in JavaScript because it can be extracted by an attacker.<sup><a href="#ref">[26]</a></sup></li>
                                  </ul>

                            <h3>Misplaced trust in developers</h3>
                            <p>Package management systems such as npm and Bower are popular with JavaScript developers. Such systems allow a developer to easily manage
                                  their program's dependencies upon other developer's program libraries. Developers trust that the maintainers of the libraries will keep them secure and
                                  up to date, but that is not always the case. A vulnerability has emerged because of this blind trust. Relied-upon libraries can have new releases that cause
                                  bugs or vulnerabilities to appear in all programs that rely upon the libraries. Inversely, a library can go unpatched with known vulnerabilities out in the wild.
                                  In a study done looking over a sample of 133k websites, researchers found 37% of the websites included a library with at least one known
                                  vulnerability.<sup><a href="#ref">[27]</a></sup></li> "The median lag between the oldest library version used on each website and the newest available version of that library is
                                  1,177 days in ALEXA, and development of some libraries still in active use ceased years ago."<sup><a href="#ref">[27]</a></sup></li> Another possibility is that the maintainer of a library
                                  may remove the library entirely. This occurred in March 2016 when Azer Koçulu removed his repository from npm. This caused all tens of thousands
                                  of programs and websites depending upon his libraries to break.<sup><a href="#ref">[28]</a><a href="#ref">[29]</a></sup></li>
